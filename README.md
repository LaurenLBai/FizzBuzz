# FizzBuzz
This a coding practice program where it will print the numbers from 1 to 100.
For multiples of three, the word 'Fizz' will print instead of the number.
For multiples of five, the word 'Buzz' will print instead of the number.
For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, the word 'FizzBuzz'
will print instead of the number.

For example (partial sketch of the output):

1
2
3   Fizz
4
5   Buzz
6
7

15  FizzBuzz
.
.
33  Buzz
.
.
100 Buzz 

I created the program one case at time and then put it all together.
